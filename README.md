<h4>A Recipe/Ordering app for small businesses</h4>
This app will help small businesses (such as karenderyas/small caf√©s) to manage their food for customers. This app demonstrates the process of setting up recipes that can be cook and sold.

<h2>NOTE</h2>
<h4>The app does not have an APK yet. Follow the steps below on how to test the app</h4>

1. To run the app, download Visual Studio 2022 and fork this repository.
2. You can clone your fork on the "<>code" icon. Copy the URL, and go back to VS2022.
3. In VS2022, click "clone a repository" and paste the link you have copied.

5. To test it in mobile, you need to turn on debugging mode in developer's settings of your phone before plugging it in a USB charger connecting to a PC/machine.
6. After connecting the phone to your connected USB charger, go back to VS2022 and press the dropdown next to "Windows Machine". You will see "Android Local Device" with your device's name.

7. Click the local device and run the program.
8. Since this app uses a local database, make the username "admin" (all small letters) to access the admin features of the app. Otherwise, you will access the user features.
9. As mentioned in item 5, you can tour the user features by registering a user in other names than "admin".
10. Now you can test the app freely in either user or admin.
